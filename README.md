RapidBreeze
===========

RapidBreeze as a name is a joke. 

This is a project which creates an UML editor with a command line
interface.  I don't like to use pen/paper for drawing diagramsand I
need something which will make UML diagrams *fast*.

Therefore I want to be able to create UML diagrams using command line.
